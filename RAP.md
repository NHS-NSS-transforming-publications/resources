# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

A Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) carries out all the steps of the production process of a statistical publication in one open source software program, from data extraction to report production. It combines best practice in academia and data science in order to improve the quality, auditability and speed of publication production, as well as ensure knowledge transfer in organisations with high turnover in staff. Although a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline may not be appropriate for every publication, implementing just one or two techniques such as version control or peer review has the potential to improve quality and make efficiency savings. These concepts can also be applied to any repetitive piece of work which needs to be carried out on a regular basis, not just publications.

A good place to start with RAP is [this blog post](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) by Matt Upson, which describes the work of the Government Digital Service to transform the way official statistics are produced. Matt Upson and his colleague Matthew Gregory have also produced the [RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/), which provides a wealth of information about their work and the creation of RAP, and this [free online course](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using R.
