No, no, no - not _that_ kind of rap :see_no_evil:...

The Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) is a concept we are just starting to bring into the TPP work, but it's an area we plan to really focus on going forward. A good place to start with RAPs is [this blog post](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) by Matt Upson, which describes the work of the Government Digital Service to transform the way official statistics are produced. Matt Upson and his colleague Matthew Gregory have also produced the [RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/), which provides a wealth of information about their work and the creation of RAPs. They have also put together this [free online course](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using R.
