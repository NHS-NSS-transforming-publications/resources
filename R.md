# R Resources

## R Coding Style
The [R style guide for PHI analysts](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/PHI%20R%20style%20guide.md) is available in the [PHI Health and Social Care R resources repo](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources). We strongly recommend that R users follow these guidelines as closely as possible as we strive to achieve code that is *_reproducible, shareable and efficient_* (our new mantra :pray:). The style guide should be seen as an evolving document, so please share any thoughts you have about how to improve it and keep an eye on it for updates.

We recommend using the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham in conjunction with the PHI style guide. This is a comprehensive style guide covering object names, spacing, assignment (`<-` not `=` being another of our mantras), functions, the pipe operator `%>%` and much more.

## RStudio projects
RStudio projects are a great way to keep your R work well organised, and to enable the use of [version control methods](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/resources/blob/master/version-control.md) such as Git. A brief introduction to projects by RStudio can be found [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207).

## Tidyverse (i.e. Hadley Wickham)
A few videos from the tidyverse wizard himself:
- "dplyr" tutorial at useR 2014: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SGif63VW6E
- EdinbR lecture covering "dplyr", "purrr", "tidyr" and "broom", April 2016: http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2016/05/11/may-Hadley-Update2-PostingTalk.html

## eBooks
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) by Colin Gillespie
- [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham

## Local R community
- [EdinbR: The Edinburgh R Usergroup](http://edinbr.org/) hold local meetups (usually once a month) and training for the R programming language.
