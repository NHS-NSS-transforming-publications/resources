For the sake of our future selves, let's
>keep calm and apply version control methods

# General
For some background on version control methods in general:
- [Atlassian: What is version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

# GitHub
- [Intro to GitHub](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/Intro-to-GitHub/) An introductory video to the GitHub workflow from GitHub themselves.
- [How to Use Git and GitHub - Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) A free online course, approximate time to complete is 12 hours.

# Git
Once you are familiar with the GitHub workflow and have had a bit of practice using the integrated buttons in RStudio (see resources below), we would highly recommend trying out the command line. The integrated functionality of Git/GitHub with RStudio is excellent, but it does have some limitations. Learning a few basic git commands will give you a lot more flexibility, for example when using branches.

- [Setting Commit Email Address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/) - NB: this needs to be done separately within the RStudio terminal if also committing with RStudio
