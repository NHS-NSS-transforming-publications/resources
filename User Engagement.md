As part of the Transforming Publishing Programme, we have conducted a number of user engagement and usability testing sessions. It is vital that users are part of the development, or re-development, of a statistical publication so that we can ensure that the final product meets their needs and is usable. This means involving users before, during and after development. This page contains links to papers written by the Transforming Publishing team and other resources on how best to conduct user research. :family:
