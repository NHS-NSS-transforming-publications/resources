# D3.js

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library to create data-visualisations developed my Mike Bostock. D3 stands for data driven documents and help to turn data into visualisations using in webpages. Advantages of D3.js are that it is very customisable and can scale to the screen because it uses [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), one of the down-sides of D3.js is that it can have a fairly steep learning curve.
